    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking the pasta.</li>
        <li>Then make the meat and the sauce.</li>
        <li>Layer meat and sauce with lasagna.</li>
        <li>Top with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake</li>
    </ol>
